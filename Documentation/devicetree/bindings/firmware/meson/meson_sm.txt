* Amlogic Secure Monitor

In the Amlogic SoCs the Secure Monitor code is used to provide access to the
NVMEM, enable JTAG, set USB boot, etc...

Required properties for the secure monitor node:
- compatible: Should be "amlogic,meson-sm"
- amlogic,sm-cmd-input-base: SMC32 function identifier to read the physical
                             address of the input buffer
- amlogic,sm-cmd-output-base: SMC32 function identifier to read the physical
                              address of the output buffer

Example:

	#include <dt-bindings/firmware/meson-gxbb-sm.h>

	...

	firmware {
		compatible = "simple-bus";

		secure-monitor {
			compatible = "amlogic,meson-sm";
			amlogic,sm-cmd-input-base = <SM_GET_SHARE_MEM_INPUT_BASE>;
			amlogic,sm-cmd-output-base = <SM_GET_SHARE_MEM_OUTPUT_BASE>;
		};
	};

Node of a device using the secure monitor must have a custom property to
specify the SMC32 function the driver is going to use. The values of all the
SMC function identifiers are listed in a SoC-specific header file:

"include/dt-bindings/firmware/meson-gxbb-sm.h" - for the Meson GXBB secure monitor.

Example of the node using the secure monitor:

	#include <dt-bindings/firmware/meson-gxbb-sm.h>

	...

	efuse: efuse {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxbb-efuse";
		amlogic,sm-cmd-read-efuse = <SM_EFUSE_READ>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		...
	};
